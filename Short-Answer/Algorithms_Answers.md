#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The time complexity for while loop is O(n), this mean the algorithm will walk trough
   the range of 0 and n*n*n.


b) The time complexity of the this function is O(n^2), because it has loop inside a loop.
   The for loop time complexity is O(n) and the for while loop is also O(n).


c) The time complexity of this function is O(n), this function is using a fixed number of operations, 
   if 0 retuens 0, otherwise make recursive to bunnyEars(bunnies-1).

## Exercise II
Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution
